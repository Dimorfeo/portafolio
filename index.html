    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Though my experience of being an Industrial engineer student and leader in diverse roles, I drive to bring innovation and growth through limited resources to all my projects and jobs. My ability to lead, work with, and motivate my team have taken me through many situations, some include failure and feedback, that have made my team and me grow, and others let me verify my progress with success and allow me to see different pictures and opportunities. Overall, my passion for continuous improvement, technical and soft skills, make me ideal to be in any environment and always seeking to growth together.
        I ́m very interested in projects that are out the box in AI, Cloud, Simulation, Logistics, Supply Chain Management for perishable goods and volunteering.</p>
